# Introduction 
This extension adds support, for **JasperReports** (a BI tool to create reports).  
It captures each queryString tag inside the different .jrxml files analyzed.  
The objective is to create a link from this object to the called tables and views in the participating DB.  

<a name="situation"></a>
# In what situation should you install this extension?
When your JEE application makes usage of JasperReports and .jrxml files are delivered along with Java source code.  
There is a participating database.  
You want links from these reports to the database artifacts.  
This extension will analyze .jrxml source files.

# CAST AIP versions compatibility
This extension is compatible with all AIP versions 8.3.x  
# JasperReports versions compatibility

This extension is compatible with following versions of JasperReports:

| JasperReports version   | Supported | Comment |
| ------------------------|:---------:|:--------|
| JasperReports 1.0       |   ![Supported](https://github.com/CAST-Extend/com.castsoftware.uc.peoplesoft.security/blob/master/check.png)  |   |
| JasperReports 3.5       |   ![Supported](https://github.com/CAST-Extend/com.castsoftware.uc.peoplesoft.security/blob/master/check.png)  |   |
| JasperReports 3.6       |   ![Not Supported](https://github.com/CAST-Extend/com.castsoftware.uc.peoplesoft.security/blob/master/check.png)  |   |

# Configuration instructions
Once registered, this extension is integrated to the normal process of a Universal analysis.

# Operation instructions
## Source preparation and analysis configuration instructions

Deliver your Java source code as normal.  
There is no preprocessor required for .jrxml files (Jasper Report XML template).  
  
Create manually an Analysis Unit for **language JasperReport** and select the **root** of Java source code in **Deploy folder**.  

## Analysis processing

Analysis will be conducted as follow:       
* The UA engine will run on the selected source code, and save JasperReport objects in the Analysis Service.  
  * This task produces a log file, important to check.             

## Checks to be performed upon analysis

As for any analysis, the following checks must be performed in order to ensure correct results:       
* Check the logs described above:
  * Error should be fixed.
  * Warning messages should be explained or fixed                

* Check Analysis Unit content
  * Check at least that the number of JasperReportProgram is equal with the DMT package content (number of .jrxml files)
In case of mismatch, there is likely a parsing error.
- Use **UA Assistant** tool, Preview feature to test interactively a few source files (preprocessed ones).
- Adapt the LanguagePattern.xml's regexp if needed.

# What results can you expect?
Custom objects will be created in Analysis Service as follow:
